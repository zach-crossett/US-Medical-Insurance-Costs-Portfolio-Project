_"You are now tasked with working with actual information from a dataset and performing your own independent analysis on real-world data! We will not be providing step-by-step instructions on what to do, but we will provide you with a framework to structure your exploration and analysis."_

**Project Objectives:**
- Work locally on your own computer
- Import a dataset into your program
- Analyze a dataset by building out functions or class methods
- Use libraries to assist in your analysis
- Optional: Document and organize your findings
