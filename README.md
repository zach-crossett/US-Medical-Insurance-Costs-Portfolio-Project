# US-medical-insurance-costs-python-portfolio-project

In this project I investigated a dataset of medical insurance costs from a .csv file using Python.

This project comes from Codecademy's Data Science Foundations curriculum.  The following is from the project's description:  _"You are now tasked with working with actual information from a dataset and performing your own independent analysis on real-world data! We will not be providing step-by-step instructions on what to do, but we will provide you with a framework to structure your exploration and analysis."_
